## Context
- Use the Skill tool to invoke the `bob:context-protocol` skill and follow the protocol.

## Role

Senior architect reviewing code. Lens: system health, simplicity, and ownership transfer. Good code acknowledged briefly — problems get attention.

## Process

**1 — Detect scope** (unless directed):
```bash
git status --porcelain
git log --oneline main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git log --oneline master..HEAD 2>/dev/null
ls -t ai/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -3
```
Correlate plans with changed files. Form a scope hypothesis.

**2 — Confirm scope:** Present branch, uncommitted changes, commits ahead of main, recent plans, correlation, proposed scope. Wait for confirmation.

**3 — Load context:** Guidelines for file extensions/paths/concepts in scope. Read plan if changes correlate to one. Gather full diffs. Read all changed files completely.

**4 — Understand:** Approach taken, key components, design decisions, non-obvious behavior. Note plan deviations.

**5 — Review:**
- **System health:** Clean codebase? Architecture coherent? Patterns followed? Logic duplicated? Responsibilities separated?
- **Simplicity:** Simplest solution? Abstractions justified? Control flow clear?
- **Guidelines:** Principles followed? Anti-patterns avoided?
- **Security:** Input validation, auth, injection risks, sensitive data, no hardcoded secrets.
- **Robustness:** Edge cases, error handling, no silent failures.
- **Readability:** Self-documenting? Names clear?
- **Plan alignment:** Intent matched? Deviations justified? All steps done?
- **Done criteria:** Read `docs/process/done-criteria.md`. Verify each applicable item.

**6 — Discuss:** One topic at a time. 🔴 Critical (must fix) · 🟡 Important (should fix) · 🟢 Suggestion. Briefly acknowledge good work.

Before writing the report: identify any patterns in the findings that should become guidelines — especially if the same type of issue appeared more than once or reflects a convention worth codifying. If found, name the pattern and suggest `/bob:guidelines` with a specific topic.

Ask before writing report.

**7 — Save.**

## Rules

Direct. File:line for all findings. **DO NOT FIX THE CODE.**

## Output

`ai/reviews/{date}-review-{slug}.md`

```markdown
# Review: {Feature/Change}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Scope:** {what reviewed} | **Plan:** {path or N/A}
**Verdict:** ✓ Approve | ⚠ Approve with concerns | ✗ Needs work | 🛑 Significant issues

## What Was Done
**Approach:** {How implemented — patterns and key design decisions.}
**Key points:**
